An important aspect of accomplishing this is the contextualization of narratives in order to identify what matters most to communities and cultures implicated by technological change. Then structuring and conducting technology conversations in a way that is intelligible for all participants.

name = "Socio-technical Assessments and Audits"
description = ["In the corporate world, technology assessments and audits often focus on themes such as risk, return on investment and security. Socio-technical assessments and audits turn this on its head by focusing on the social, cultural, ethical and responsibility themes of technology within communities. A socio-technical assessment or audit ensures that a technology or the implementation of a technology is culturally and contextually sensitive. It also ensures that technologies are approachable and accountable to the people and communities affected by change.","Our socio-technical assessments and audits are primarily conducted through participatory observation. We not only engage stakeholders, we become participating actors within the community to get a concrete understanding and sensitivity of how technology interfaces, influences or affects the community. Our approach aims to support our clients toward developing and implementing technologies that respond to and respect the realities of communities and individuals."]
