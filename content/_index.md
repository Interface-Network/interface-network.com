**We envision a world where societies and communities have choice and control, through participation and dialogue to engage in the co-construction of responsible technologies.**

Interface.Network is an action and research technology governance agency. We foster collaboration and narrative building to overcome complex issues and power imbalances. We aim towards the co-creation of culturally sensitive and approachable networks, systems and processes.
